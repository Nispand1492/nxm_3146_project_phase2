###a.What Server framework did you choose and Why?

I have choosen Ruby on Rails (Ruby version 2.2.0 and Rails 4.2.0) because of following reasons:
-Ruby includes several syntactic features which made dynamic extension of and higher-order interaction with external code more straightforward.
-Mix-ins allow imported classes and modules to be extended and overridden by user code after it is imported.
-Rails provide extension classes and methods to ruby
-While other languages have data structures like linked lists ,decision trees etc Ruby has really handful of more powerful data structures than other similar languages that can be molded to suit the needs & having purposes of those data structures as well as new data structures.
-handles migrations.

###b.What client side framework did you choose and Why?

I have choosen JQuery for client side scripting because of following reasons:
-Easy to Operate Document Object Modelling(DOM).
-Easy to execute AJAX request and JSON call.
-Do not have to worry about Cross Browser Compatibality
-Support functionality which tests to see if certain features are available on current users browser or not.
-Integration between javascript and JQuery.


###c.What aspects of Implementation did you find easy and Why?

Hardcoding of JSON files were comparitively wasy then that of XML as it resembles to the real world data representation more easily.
Designing HTML pages were quite easy and mapping of CSS files and JQuery in it was not that difficult.

###d.What aspects of Implementation did you find difficult and Why?

Getting acquainted with rails framework was difficult initially and learning the routes to be defined was hard for me initially as I do not have any web development experiance.

###e. What components OTHER than your client and server framework did you install, if any, and if so, what is their purpose for your solution?

bundle install command prepares the server side environment.Other than that I haven't used any other components.
